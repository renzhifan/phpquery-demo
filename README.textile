h1. phpQuery - pq();

phpQuery is a server-side, chainable, CSS3 selector driven Document Object Model (DOM) API based on jQuery JavaScript Library.
Library is written in PHP5 and provides additional Command Line Interface (CLI). 

h2. This Repo..

..aims to gather all/most forks and contrib code into one coherent and complete repo.

h4. Maintainers wanted

I don't plan to take role as a maintainer in the medium/long run.. i'm just a (fairly new) user of phpquery who was perplexed by all the mess - scattered forks and edits - out there ;). Thus: whoever wishes to take an active role as maintainer: feel free to contact me, and i'll hand over the ownership of this repo.

h4. State

30.1.2014: Initial setup.. branches, tags, contrib branches.. no merges/picks done so far.
